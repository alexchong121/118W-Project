	<h2><font size="6">The Amazon: Life Itself</font></h2>
	<p>Rainforests support us. They help maintain the worldwide atmosphere and are imperative to keep up the world's delicate parity. The Amazon rainforest is the world's biggest and most biodiverse tropical rainforest, covering a region bigger than the mainland United States. It houses 33% of the Earth's plant and creature species and produces one-fifth of all its streaming new water.</p>

	<p>About 400 unmistakable indigenous people groups rely upon the Amazon rainforest for their physical and social endurance. At current paces of deforestation, almost 50 percent of the Amazon could be lost or seriously debased continuously 2020, and most by far will never again be in an unblemished state.</p>

	<p>With worldwide deforestation causing 20–25 percent of all GHG emissions, Amazon Preservation Association, and our indigenous accomplices are striving to protect all mankind as we together try to safeguard the rainforest. Every one of us can help. We might be the last age that gets an opportunity to secure this valuable treasure of our reality's social and biological legacy – a key wellspring of life and motivation.</p>

	<br>

	<h2><font size="6">Our Mission</font></h2>
	<p >Our group is dedicated to the survival the amazon rainforest. Deforestation, and wild fires have been a key factor is the destruction of the rainforect. If you did'nt know humans emit around 12 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere, which deeply affects climate change. The Amazon acts as a bank to hold much of these carbons, and with its destruction much of the carbon stored is being released. If you are concerned about climate change and the many species living in the Amazon please help us.
	</p>

	<br>

	<h2><font size="6">Our Vision</font></h2>
	<p>We hope to promote awareness of the disasters occurring as the survival of the Amazon is extremely important to the world. Our vision is of a future where tropical forests are flourishing and the local population engage in a good-natured relationship where both can thrive, and add to the prosperity of the planet.
	</p>

	<br>

	<h2><font size="6">Our Values</font></h2>
	<h2>Integrity:</h2>
	<p>We are resolute about our mission and values and won't bargain them in any way, shape or form. We decide to work with those who adhere to the same morals and principals as us since we aim to do what's right by the environment and it's surroundings.
	</p>
	<h2>Interdependence:</h2>
	<p>We believe it is imperative that tropical forests and local communities that reside within coexist and respect all that is around as together they make the Amazon whole. We work to ensure and fortify both and prevent either from being displaced.
	</p>
	<h2>Understanding:</h2>
	<p>We acknowledge that the understanding and practices of indigenous and neighbouring communities are vital to the preservation of the Amazon. We likewise understand that customary information and western innovation can cooperate to oversee and secure the forest in addition to supporting communities.
	</p>
	<h2>Trust:</h2>
	<p>One of the main reasons we are able to accomplish what we set out to do is because of our partners. By respecting and listening to the local communities, the relationships we develop ensures that we will do what's right by them and all those involved.
	</p>
